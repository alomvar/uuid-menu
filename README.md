# Installation

Currently you have to build it by yourself with Xcode. As there is no fancy magic inside it should work without problems.

# Usage

As usual with Mac apps you just open it. A menu icon will be added with which you control the app. The app does automatically start on login but it can easily be added to your login items in OS X user preferences.
