A menu bar application for macOS to quickly generate UUIDs and copy them to the clipboard.

Whenever you might feel the itch to get a unique identifier to copy in paste in what you are doing, here is the solution.

## Installation

Currently you have to build it by yourself with Xcode. As there is no fancy magic inside it should work without problems. Providing a download of the prebuilt map [~is planned~ has been thought about](https://github.com/peterthomashorn/uuid-menu/issues/1).

## Usage

As usual with Mac apps you just open it. A system menu icon will be added with which you control the app.

The app does automatically start on login but it can easily be added to your login items in macOS user preferences. Displaying notifications can be controlled via macOS notifications preferences, too.
